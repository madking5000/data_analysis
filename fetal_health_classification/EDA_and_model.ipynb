    "#### Fetal Health prediction-classification analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "##### overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to predicts fetal health status  to allow Doctors and health care professions to act fast, in low and limited resource settings by identifying mothers with abnormal features on cardiotocogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem\n",
    "Child and Maternal Health is one of  critical issues facing our country, The UN expects by 2030, countries to end preventable death of Newborns and Under 5 years children. With the aim to reduce to at least as low as 25 per 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel to child mortality, also there is ** maternal mortality in 2017 accounted for 295000 **, and 94% of these occured in LMICs, in which most can be Prevented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiotocogram is small cost effective tool that use ultrasound waves to assess both fetal and maternal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action immediately \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. what factors  most strongly influence Fetal health status ?\n",
    "2. which Mothers and their babies requires immediate attention versus waiting? \n",
